MiniQbt the (virtual) quantum computer for dummies!

MiniQbt is a generic quantum computer simulator that can emulate the IBM quantum experience. 
Itâ€™s purpose is to place a layer of abstraction on the matrices that build the gates and instead focusses why a quantum state requires a specific matrix for each instruction.
